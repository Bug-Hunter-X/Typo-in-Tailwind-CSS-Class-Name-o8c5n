# Typo in Tailwind CSS Class Name

This repository demonstrates a common error when using Tailwind CSS: a typo in a class name.

The `bug.js` file contains a component with a misspelled Tailwind CSS class name.  This leads to unexpected styling issues.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected code with the correctly spelled class name.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.js` and observe the incorrect styling.
3. Open `bugSolution.js` and observe the correct styling.

## Solution

Carefully review your Tailwind CSS class names for any typos.  Tailwind's IntelliSense in your code editor (if available) can help prevent these errors.
